# how this works

the course you've found yourself in is a study on javascript patterns book that will be written by jasmine tests. If that sounds weird to you then you're probably in the wrong place. If you're into this then read on.

This repo is for chapter 1.
since it's a github repo, it uses issues.


## your responsibility

is to submit an issue with your jasmine tested notes about javascript patterns. An issue is simply you making your code public. It will not harm you or any other code bases. So, you will make an issue, and push your chapter 1 related comments and questions in your issue. you will be pleasantly surprised that github makes conversations about code very easy because we get immediate context.

## example

my name is @wwwoodall and my commits and issues will be an example for you. feel free to ping me with comments and/or questions on my commits. That's what issues are for :-)
